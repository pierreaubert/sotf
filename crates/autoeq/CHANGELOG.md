# 0.4.22

- Frequency-dependent correction depth: max_boost_envelope field on OptimizerConfig with log-frequency interpolation. Applied in DE optimizer fitness evaluation.
- Decomposed correction as default:  decomposed_correction defaults to Some(enabled: true). Schroeder raised to 250Hz, steady-state weight lowered to 0.4. Falls back to freq-domain-only mode detection when no IR.
- Stronger bass assymetry: AsymmetricLossConfig extended with bass_peak_weight=5.0, bass_dip_weight=0.2, transition_freq=300Hz. Smooth sigmoid crossfade in loss computation.
- Channel matching priority: Threshold tightened 1.5→0.75dB, max_filters 3→5. Pre-pass computes shared mean SPL so all channels optimize toward same target.
- First-reflection cancellation: New reflection_cancel.rs module. Uses SSIR to identify first reflection, designs LP-filtered IIR echo subtraction (Johnston method) below 500Hz.
- Windowed measurement: direct/early/late windows using SSIR boundaries, computes per-window FR with smoothing.

# 0.4.21

- implemented proper delay detection and analysis (following AES presentation Acoustic and Psychoacoustic issues in Room Correction James D. (jj) Johnston and Serge Smirnov)
