# Unreleased

## Features

- Spinorama demo now solves its shell layout with `gpui-builder` and uses the
  design system for spacing and typography.
- Added design-aware GPUI config helpers for axes, grids, legends, glyph text,
  GPU 2D/3D surfaces, and common shape defaults.
- Spinorama CEA2034 and horizontal/vertical SPL legends can hide or show their
  corresponding curves. Horizontal and vertical SPL plots now use discrete line
  legend entries by angle instead of a contour-style color scale.

## Fixes

- Fixed GPU 3D contour surface, isoline, and grid-line rendering artifacts so
  clipped segments do not connect across gaps and grid lines stay behind the
  surface.
- Made 3D surface isolines depth-aware so foreground surface geometry occludes
  far-side contour strokes.
- Fixed spinorama frequency plot X-axis alignment when a secondary DI axis is
  present, and centered line legends within their legend panels.
- Made spinorama horizontal/vertical SPL signed-angle traces easier to inspect:
  negative angles are rendered as dashed high-contrast lines with matching
  legend markers so overlapped `-60°` and `60°` traces can be toggled
  independently.
- Spinorama horizontal/vertical SPL plots now include a `0°` on-axis fallback
  from CEA2034 data when the directivity trace set does not expose one.
- Aligned spinorama legend line markers with the middle of their labels.
- Updated the d3rs showcase to inherit theme and design tokens for text and UI
  chrome outside the color demo.

# 0.7.0

## Breaking Changes

- `d3rs::fetch` parsing is now `Result`-first: `parse_csv`, `parse_tsv`,
  `parse_dsv`, `DsvParser::parse`, and `DsvParser::parse_rows` return
  structured `DsvParseError` values instead of silently returning empty data on
  malformed input.

## Features

- Added explicit lossy helpers (`parse_csv_lossy`, `parse_tsv_lossy`,
  `parse_dsv_lossy`, `DsvParser::parse_lossy`, and
  `DsvParser::parse_rows_lossy`) for D3-compatible demo paths.
- Added `ColumnPolicy::Strict` for header/row width validation plus empty and
  duplicate header rejection.
- DSV parsing now handles quoted newlines and CRLF input while reporting line,
  column, byte offset, and structured error kinds.

## Fixes

- `CsvOptions::default()` now matches `CsvOptions::new()` instead of disabling
  empty-line skipping and value trimming.

# 0.6.9

## Features

- `gpu3d::Lines3DElement`: new GPUI element rendering line / polygon scenes via CPU projection (`Camera3D::project_to_screen`) + `gpui::PathBuilder`. Same orbit / pan / zoom semantics as `Surface3DElement` through a shared `Lines3DState` (`Rc<RefCell<_>>`); parents wire mouse handlers to drive the embedded `OrbitControls`. Designed for sparse 3D scenes (~50 vertices) where a full wgpu pipeline would be overkill.

## Fixes

- **voronoi_airports example**: track `math-delaunay` API change — `triangles` and `halfedges` are now methods, not public fields. Updated callsites to use `.triangles()` / `.halfedges()`. Unblocks workspace compile.

# 0.6.8

## Features

- Added 3d lines with wpgu support

# 0.6.7

## Features

### Stroke dash array support for line rendering

- Added `StrokeDashArray` enum with predefined patterns (`Dotted`, `Dashed`,
  `DashDot`) and `Custom(Vec<f32>)` for arbitrary dash/gap sequences.
- Added `dash_array` field to `LineConfig` and a `.dash_array()` builder method.
- `render_line` now walks along line segments and splits them into dash/gap
  sub-segments when a pattern is set. The pattern state carries continuously
  across segments for seamless dashing.
- Re-exported `StrokeDashArray` from `shape::mod` and `lib.rs` prelude.
