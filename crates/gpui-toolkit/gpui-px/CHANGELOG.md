# Unreleased

## Features

- Added public `ChartSize` support plus `.fill()`, `.min_size(...)`,
  `.aspect_ratio(...)`, and `.design(...)` builder methods across PX charts.
- PX charts now default to responsive fill sizing while preserving
  `.size(width, height)` as the fixed-size opt-in.

## Fixes

- Chart plot geometry now resolves from `ChartSize` so responsive minimums and
  aspect ratios are reflected in scales, canvases, and plot bounds.

# 0.6.4

## Fixes

- **Boxplot**: `bins(0)` now returns `ChartError::InvalidData` instead of
  panicking via `num_bins - 1` underflow / division by zero in
  `calculate_boxes`.
- **Pie**: an empty user-supplied colors slice now falls back to the
  default palette instead of dividing by zero in `colors[i % colors.len()]`.

# 0.6.3

## Features

- Stroke dash array support (`.dash_array(StrokeDashArray::Dashed)`) for line charts
- Migrated showcase to design system / builder pattern
- Re-exported `StrokeDashArray` from `gpui_px`

## Fixes

- Clippy and metadata cleanup
- Showcase dash pattern demo (Solid, Dashed, Dotted, Dash-Dot, Custom)

# 0.6.2

## Features
