# Unreleased

## New

- Added an initial Android GPUI platform backend scaffold, adapted from
  `itsbalamurali/gpui-mobile`, with NativeActivity lifecycle wiring, Android
  window/input modules, and wgpu/Vulkan surface plumbing.

## Fixed

- Handle NativeActivity launches where a native window is already available
  before a fresh `InitWindow` event reaches the event loop, and mark Android
  windows active after surface initialization.
- Improve Android renderer startup diagnostics for emulator GPU stacks that
  only expose GLES without the storage-buffer limits required by GPUI.
- Resolve GPUI's `.SystemUI` virtual font family through the configured Android
  system fallback so Android themes can use the same system font alias as iOS.
